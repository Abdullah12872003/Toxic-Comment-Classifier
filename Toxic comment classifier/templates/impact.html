            <p>Bad comments, if left unchecked, can have significant negative consequences on individuals and communities, including:</p>
            
            <p>1. Psychological Harm: Negative or abusive comments can cause psychological distress, leading to stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.</p>
            
            <p>2. Damage to Reputation: Individuals targeted by bad comments may suffer damage to their reputation, both personally and professionally. This can affect their relationships, career prospects, and overall well-being.</p>
            
            <p>3. Erosion of Trust: Communities plagued by toxic comments may experience a breakdown of trust among members. This can lead to decreased engagement, loss of community cohesion, and eventual disintegration.</p>
            
            <p>4. Impaired Productivity: Constant exposure to negative comments can hinder productivity and creativity. It may distract individuals from their tasks, diminish their motivation, and contribute to a toxic work or social environment.</p>
            Comment filtration is an essential component of managing online communities and platforms. In today's
                digital age, where communication happens predominantly through digital mediums such as social media,
                forums, and comment sections on websites, ensuring that these spaces remain constructive and safe for
                users is paramount.
